            <h2>HourlyMe</h2>
            <p class="description">
              This mobile app is written in Javascript/React Native. It allows
              users to track their earnings by the minute instead of the hour.
              By entering an hourly wage, users can see how much money theyâ€™re
              making as they work, providing a unique perspective on their
              hourly job. The app functions as a timer that tracks earnings, not
              time.

              This Python script estimates the time required to complete a
              project based on the number of pieces, the user's skill level, and
              a quick timed session to predict how many pieces can be assembled
              in a set period. The tool then calculates the total time needed
              for the entire project based on this data.

            <h2>12 Nights of Fright</h2>
            <p class="description">
              This dungeon-crawler game was written in Java. It allows players
              to explore rooms, examine items, and uncover clues to escape. Set
              in a Christmas-themed abandoned mansion, the game features puzzles
              and challenges to help users find their way out. The game was
              built using Java.
